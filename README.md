# Blender alembic export groups

## Introduction

Exporting multiple sets of objects as alembic caches from Blender requires a lot of manual work, that has to be repeated on every export, especially if different object sets have different settings. There are nearly 30 settings, imagine having to set them to specific values multiple times on each export.

This addon solves the problem by persisting "groups" of objects, each group with its own export settings, in the scene.

## How to use

- Select the objects you would like to add to a group

## Installation

Install from the Blender menu:
- Go to Edit â†’ Preferences and navigate to the Add-ons tab
- Select Install from the top
- Navigate to the addon location and open it
- Activate the addon
